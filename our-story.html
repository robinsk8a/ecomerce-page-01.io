          Our Story
        </h1>
        <p>
          Founded in the Northeast Ohio area in 1962, Home Appliance began like
          many other small, local companies-with hard work built on traditional
          values like honesty, steadfast service, and integrity. Over the years,
          they've had their ups and downs: moving to new showrooms, enduring
          recessions, and managing a huge flood over 10 years ago. Through it
          all, Home Appliance held onto a vision to be the best at what they do.
        </p>
        <p>
          From showrooms filled to the brim with every appliance imaginable to
          creating the largest delivery, installation, service, and repair
          fleets in Ohio, Home Appliance has kept its focus on one thing-the
          customer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, owners Brian and Beth Grayson lead the Home Appliance team with
          a passion for creating a first-class shopping experience for thousands
          of customers each year. Discover what makes Home Appliance a

          Brian Grayson offers this simple message to customers new and old:
          "Beth and I can tell you many stories of selling, delivering, and
          servicing appliances late into the night for customers. But the
          greatest benefit of owning Home Appliance is the relationships we have
          developed with our customers. We're grateful for the success we and
          our team have experienced, but we cherish our friendships most of all.
          Maybe we'll see you around one of our showrooms sometime. We never
          stop making new friends!"
